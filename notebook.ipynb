Imagine one day my friend Ella insists her “lucky socks” make her run faster. I was shocked — maybe she just had a good day. To find the truth, we ran a small experiment - creating our own sample data to make decisions for the general case. She ran the same distance several times with the socks and several times without.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"6e26e0ba-567a-41b4-ac0a-5fdf11512572"},{"source":"This is exactly what hypothesis testing does — it helps us decide if what we observed in a small sample truly reflects a real effect in general (population data) or just happened by luck.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"6dc6332c-cbf5-411b-9f24-3258015d3fec"},{"source":"Here's how it works: \n- The null hypothesis assumes nothing special is happening - the socks don't help.\n- The alternative hypothesis assumes something is happening - the socks actually make her faster.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"c0a9339a-fa34-494e-aa5e-2aefd3b89729"},{"source":"After that, we look at the p-value, basically a 'surprise score.'\n- A small p-value (≤ 0.05) means such a big improvement is unlikely by chance, so the socks might actually help, and we reject the null hypothesis.\n- A large p-value means the difference could happen randomly — the socks are just… socks!","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"2dbcf019-228a-4992-9ad6-6fb3d81903c0"},{"source":"In business, the same idea applies. Suppose we change our “Buy Now” button from orange to green, and see more clicks and higher sales. Before popping the champagne, we need to check if it’s really the color or just luck. A hypothesis test shows the cause of the increase: if it’s unlikely by chance, the idea is supported; if not, there’s no strong evidence yet.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"c438fd9e-1f73-4fe1-b6db-e7a6e7edd330"},{"source":"At the end of the day, data don’t lie!
